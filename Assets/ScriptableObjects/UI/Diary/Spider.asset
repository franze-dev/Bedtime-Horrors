  title: Spider
  story: "Last week we went to my aunt and uncle\u2019s country house for a birthday
    party. I love spending the night there\u2014it\u2019s such a peaceful place.
    I can enjoy the quiet that the city never gives me and spend time with my cousins.
    It would\u2019ve been one of the best nights if it hadn\u2019t been for what
    happened while Elena, my cousin, was finishing her ghost story. I felt something
    crawling on my neck. I jumped in fear, and when I looked down, I saw a huge spider
    staring at me, as if it knew it was one of my greatest fears. I don\u2019t think
    I\u2019ll ever be able to sleep on the floor again after that."
