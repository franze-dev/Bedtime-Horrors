  title: Bull Terrier
  story: "I\u2019m really scared of my neighbor\u2019s dog. Every time I come home
    from school and step onto their sidewalk, it just stares at me. It bares its
    teeth and growls, as if I don\u2019t live right next door. If it weren\u2019t
    for the leash holding it back, I think it would\u2019ve bitten me already. Sometimes
    I see it from my window, and it\u2019s impossible not to notice how it keeps
    watching me. There\u2019s something in its eyes that feels unsettling, like it\u2019s
    trying to tell me something. Maybe I remind it of its owner\u2019s daughter.
    People say she used to make it fight other dogs, and that she would punish it
    whenever it lost."
