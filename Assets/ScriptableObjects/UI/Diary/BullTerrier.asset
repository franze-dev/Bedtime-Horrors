  story: "I\u2019m really scared of the neighbour's dog. If it wasn\u2019t because
    of its leash, I think he would have already bit me. Sometimes I feel him staring
    at me through the window. Maybe I remind him of his owner\u2019s daughter. I
    think she used to make him fight against other dogs, and scolded him when he
    lost."
