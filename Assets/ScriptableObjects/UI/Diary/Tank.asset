  story: "I got really good grades on my last exam, and as a reward my parents let
    me choose a present. When we were at the toy store, I passed by the military
    toys section\u2014something I\u2019d never cared about before. But this time,
    I saw one that stood out: a little tank with a tiny figure that popped in and
    out of the hatch. The way it hid made me laugh, but also made me feel strangely
    connected to it. Maybe that\u2019s why I grew so fond of it. It took some convincing
    to get my parents to buy it, since it wasn\u2019t considered a \u201Cgirl\u2019s
    toy.\u201D In the end, I never really played with it, because I always kept it
    on my desk. I named it Mr. Lid, and it became my good luck charm\u2014it calms
    me down whenever I study."
