  title: Dino
  story: "I always loved those magic colorful dinosaurs that grew in the water. The
    problem is that they eventually dry up and I don\u2019t want the last one to
    get ruined. I imagine a world where they can play around the water all they want,
    maybe going through the rain with a raincoat just like mine, it would be so fun
    to play together."
  tutorial: The dinosaur attacks enemies at a certain range.
