  story: "I\u2019ve always loved those colorful magic dinosaurs that grow when you
    put them in water. The problem is that eventually they dry out and you have to
    soak them again. Sooner or later, they stop working, and my parents have gotten
    tired of buying me more. That\u2019s why I never put this last one in water\u2014I\u2019m
    afraid I\u2019ll never get another. But it also makes me sad to keep it dry.
    I like to imagine a world where they can play in the water as much as they want,
    maybe running through the rain in a raincoat just like mine. It would be fun
    to play together."
