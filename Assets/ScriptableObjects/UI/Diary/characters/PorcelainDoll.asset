  title: Porcelain Doll
  story: My granny used to collect porcelain dolls when she was younger, and she
    still keeps some of them above the drawer. Yesterday that I spent the night at
    her house, I swear one of them moved. I closed my eyes, thinking it was just
    my imagination, but when I opened them again, the doll was on the floor.
