  story: "Last week we visited my uncles. It would have been the best night at their
    house so far, if it wasn\u2019t because, when my cousin Elena was about to finish
    her scary story, I felt something touching my neck. I jumped in fright and when
    I looked down, there was a huge spider that stared at me as if it knew I\u2019m
    scared of them. I will never sleep on the floor again."
