  title: Tank
  story: "I never really liked military toys except for this little tank with a character
    on the top, the way it hides away in fear was so funny, but it also kinda reminds
    me of me, maybe it\u2019s because of that that I ended up getting really attached
    to it. I still have it as a lucky charm to calm me down when im studying."
  tutorial: The tank shoots bullets towards a specific direction. You need to select
    it to change its direction with the arrow keys.
