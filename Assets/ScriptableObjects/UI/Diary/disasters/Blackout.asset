  story: "Last night the lights went out and it never came back until I went to sleep,
    that was the worst night of my life, I couldn\u2019t see anything, at first my
    mother stayed with me but then she went away before I went to sleep and it took
    me a lot of time to finally sleep because of how terrified I was, luckily Ms.
    Rosie protected me."
  tutorial: The bedroom looks darker.
