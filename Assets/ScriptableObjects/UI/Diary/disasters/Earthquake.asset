  story: EvErYtHiNg Is TrEmBlInG! iT iS sO lOuD! i CaN bArElY wRiTe! HeLp! It finally
    ended, my dad told me that it was an "Earthquake", now I hate earthquakes. I
    thought that the entire house was gonna collapse and I'm sure I saw pieces fall,
    I was so scared. I'm still dizzy, my head is still ringing.
