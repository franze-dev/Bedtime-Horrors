  title: Snow Storm
  story: 'Lately it''s been really cold. I know it is winter but this time it is
    REALLY COLD. I like playing in the snow, but now I''m sick, in my bed, and there
    is nothing I can do. This Stinks! From now on I HATE winter, summer was better
    after all. At least Ms. Rosie is warm. '
