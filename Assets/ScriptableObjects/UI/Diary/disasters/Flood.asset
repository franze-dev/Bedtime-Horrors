  story: "It\u2019s raining outside, A LOT of rain. And there is water in the streets,
    A LOT of water. I think this is the end of the world, my dad told me it will
    go away tomorrow but the water is getting on the level of my window, it's impossible
    it just goes away, he\u2019s trying to lie to me so that I don\u2019t get scared
    but it\u2019s over."
