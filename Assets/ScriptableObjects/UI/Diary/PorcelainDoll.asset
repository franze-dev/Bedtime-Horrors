  title: Porcelain Doll
  story: "Last night I slept over at my grandmother\u2019s house, and I had a horrible
    experience. I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep with the sound of crickets
    outside, when I heard a noise coming from the dresser beside me. My grandmother
    used to collect porcelain dolls when she was young, and she still keeps some
    on that dresser to decorate the room. I kept staring at one of them, because
    I could\u2019ve sworn it had moved a little. I closed my eyes, thinking it was
    just my imagination, but when I opened them, the doll was on the floor with its
    jaw broken. It seemed to be looking right at me from there, with that empty,
    eerie expression I\u2019ll never forget."
