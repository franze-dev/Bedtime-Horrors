  title: Teddy
  story: "My little Teddy is my best friend. She was the first stuffed animal I was
    ever given when I was little. Back then, she was almost my size, but for some
    reason she didn\u2019t scare me\u2014she made me happy. It felt comforting to
    have her next to me, especially when I slept, like she was protecting me. Since
    then, I\u2019ve always kept her by my side. I like dressing her in my clothes,
    especially scarves and gloves that I don\u2019t usually wear. Whenever I start
    to feel scared, I feel better just remembering that she\u2019s there with me."
